Long ago, in a “previous life” both of us were medical laboratory professionals. Mixing reagents and growing bugs was something that I really enjoyed. Software development challenges and pay lured me away from the laboratory, but I have always sort of missed the precision of measuring, mixing, and testing.

When I would yen for the good ol’ days in the lab, Silvia would suggest that I start home brewing beer. It took hearing this coaxing many times before I realized it for the encouraging nudge that it truly represented.

Eventually I started trolling Craigslist for used home brewing equipment. This is the result of that search and the start of this chronicle.
