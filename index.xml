      <description>Long ago, in a “previous life” both of us were medical laboratory professionals. Mixing reagents and growing bugs was something that I really enjoyed. Software development challenges and pay lured me away from the laboratory, but I have always sort of missed the precision of measuring, mixing, and testing.
