### Strisselspalt Pilsner

The inspiartion for our new for Bluebonnet Brew-off 2019 pilsner came from a beverage that we sampled while vacationing in Virginia. A former Dallas area brewer had taken up shop at [Wort Hog Brewing](http://www.whbrew.com/) so we ducked in to see what Jeremy had gotten himself into.

We sampled the current wares and I was smitten by the [BECKHAM STREET – HOPPY PILSNER](http://www.whbrew.com/beer-menu.html). The “hoppy” bit derived from using a French hop – [Strisselspalt](https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/SNdWvdNSAt/). The beer had a wonderful aroma, a crisp hop bite, plenty of fizzy bubbles, and a quenching dry finish.

We entered a pilsner into Bluebonnet Brew-off last year, but I rushed it a bit and it didn’t do as well as we had hoped. This libation was sure to become our secret weapon in 2019.
