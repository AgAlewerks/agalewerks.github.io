      <description>Strisselspalt Pilsner The inspiartion for our new for Bluebonnet Brew-off 2019 pilsner came from a beverage that we sampled while vacationing in Virginia. A former Dallas area brewer had taken up shop at Wort Hog Brewing so we ducked in to see what Jeremy had gotten himself into.
We sampled the current wares and I was smitten by the BECKHAM STREET – HOPPY PILSNER. The “hoppy” bit derived from using a French hop – Strisselspalt.</description>

      <description>Thistle Dew Scottish Export Ale BJCP describes a Scottich Export as
A malt-focused, generally caramelly beer with perhaps a few esters and occasionally a butterscotch aftertaste. Hops only to balance and support the malt. The malt character can range from dry and grainy to rich, toasty, and caramelly, but is never roasty and especially never has a peat smoke character. The Story This beer was born out of a “Hopped Challenge” sponsored by Cobra Brewing in Lewisville, Texas.</description>
