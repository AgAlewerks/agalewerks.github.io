    <h4 class="mt-0">In the Beginning...</h4>
    <p>Long ago, in a “previous life” both of us were medical laboratory professionals. Mixing reagents and growing bugs was something that I really enjoyed. Software development challenges and pay lured me away from the
laboratory, but I have always sort of missed the precision of measuring, mixing, and testing.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">When I would yen for tgit he good ol’ days in the lab, Silvia would suggest that I start home brewing beer. It took hearing this coaxing many times before I realized it for the encouraging nudge that it truly represented. Eventually I started trolling Craigslist for used home brewing equipment. This is the result of that search and the start of this chronicle.</p>
