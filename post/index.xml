      <description>Ingredients I was flattered recently when a beer friend asked for my thoughts on the importance of each ingredient in beer. Normally beer has just four ingredients – water, barley, hops, and yeast – and with them a very wide variety of flavors can be created.
Water Everything starts with water. If you aren’t able to change the composition of the water, you should choose styles that suit water available. Since the drinking water in North Texas is sourced from Army Corp of Engineers reservoirs and subject to seasonal changes I suspected we’d have to do something to our water for anything other than the darker beers.</description>
